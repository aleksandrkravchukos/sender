# Email sender with timezones.

## Solution architecture description

* To be able to encount client's timezone this solution creates a related table "message_time_in_time_zone" with all 24 timezones relating to UTC time.

* Every minute console send command shoud be executed by cron and it selects clients and messages that should be emailed ob this menute according to timezone ( joins timesheet table with alltimezones wilt clients on timezone field - see repository query).

* Emails are sent asynonymously - added to queue using Laravel mailer and send via Laravel's background worer solution.

* This implementation uses relational database as tranport for worker, but in prodyction implementation its better to use amqp brokers like Rabbbit Mq.

* TODOs:
  
  - The is a drawback that in case some minute is missed by cron. the email for this minute will not be sent. For this case It may be needed to add additional logic.

  - .env  / .env.testing and phpunit.xml in the real projects should be in dist files with dummy values, but for simplification I've left them as is without dist.
    
  - add not success cases to tests and check point that may need exception handling
  
Task.

* The company has a database of customers who need to send email messages throughout the day. Each client is in its own time zone. Each message has a sending schedule (e.g. 12:00, 13:02). 

* Each message can be sent an unlimited number of times throughout the day and are not tied to customers.

* You need to write a console command that will send emails to clients at the right time in the clientâ€™s time zone, provided that the application server is running on UTC + 02: 00. 

* Keep messages, schedules and customers need in the database. Create models, migrations, seeders.

* When developing, consider the size of the message base and clients.
* Customers in the database - 1 million.
* Messages - 10 thousand

* Requirements: use the Laravel framework.

* Inform the time of the task.

* all sent messages go to fake smtp server <a href="https://prnt.sc/tcf7b6">mailtrap</a>. 
* You can change your credentials in env file for testing your app.
